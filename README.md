# User Management

User Management is a simple CRUD application built with React.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It provides basic functionality to manage a list of users, allowing users to be created, edited, and deleted. Instead of using a traditional database, the application utilizes local storage to store user data.
